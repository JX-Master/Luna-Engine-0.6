	//! @interface IStream
	//! Represents a memory block or a device that holds a sequence of bytes and supports read/write 
	//! operations on them. The main implementation of `IStream` is `IFile` and `IMemoryStream`, which
	//! inputs/outputs data into a file or a memory chunk.
	//! 
	//! This object is not thread safe and the I/O operations on this object is not asynchronous (will suspend
	//! the current thread until the operation is done or failed). For an asynchronous version of stream, using 
	//! `IAsyncStream` instead.

		//! The actual size of bytes being read may be smaller than the size of bytes required to be read if the cursor
		//! reaches the end of the stream, but this is NOT an error. Specially, if one read operation is performed when
		//! the cursor is beyond or at the end of the stream, the read operation succeeds with 0 bytes being read. This
