	//! @interface IMutex
	//! @threadsafe
	//! The mutex or critical section is an important object that provides
	//! synchronization functionality for multiple threads that wants to 
	//! access the same resource without data race. The mutex can be "owned"
	//! by at most one thread, when other threads wants to acquire the mutex,
	//! it must wait until the thread that currently owns the mutex to release
	//! the mutex. The threads that waits on the mutex will probably be suspended
	//! by system.
	//! 
	//! The mutex can be acquired recursively, that is, the thread that already owns
	//! the mutex can make additional calls to acquire the mutex, so long as it makes 
	//! one release call for each acquire call to finally release the mutex.
	//! 
	//! Acquiring the mutex from one thread and releasing from another thread is not allowed.
