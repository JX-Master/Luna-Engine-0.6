# Luna Engine v0.6

This repository hosts the source code for Luna Engine v0.6, which is currently my personal game engine project for learning & research purposes.

This 0.6 version of Luna Engine is only a prototype version and I open sources it in case that it might be useful for you. I strongly recommend that you should **NOT** use the 0.6 version of the engine in any serious project and in any real production environment.
